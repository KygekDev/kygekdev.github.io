									<h2>Founded KygekTeam</h2>
									<p>KygekTeam initially started as Kygek Development. In July 2020, KygekDev made a Discord server for support and discussions about his plugins, after he published his first PocketMine-MP, KygekJoinUI. The Discord server was named Kygek Development. Then he made more plugins and a website as a downloads and links center to all of his plugins. After he had made enough plugins, had enough users and staff, he decided to change Kygek Development to KygekTeam. He continued making more plugins and improving the website. He also made a working PHAR Converter, mainly for PocketMine-MP plugins. KygekTeam finally got its domain in December 2020.</p>
									<p>KygekTeam has published many plugins on Poggit and received tens of thousands of downloads. KygekTeam also has helped many people with PocketMine-MP plugin development.</p>

									<h2>Helped Many Minecraft Servers and Others</h2>

He has helped with technical and PocketMine-MP plugins common issues in several Minecraft servers. Currently, he is planning to make a new Minecraft server under the KygekTeam organization.</p>
									<p>KygekDev understands how difficult it is to learn to make PocketMine-MP plugins and manage technical stuff related to Minecraft servers. That's why he has helped many people, mainly with technical stuff and PocketMine-MP plugins privately and through the KygekTeam Discord server. Currently, he is planning to help many people to learn to make a Minecraft server using PocketMine-MP.</p>
